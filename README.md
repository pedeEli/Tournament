# Tournament Creator

## Idea

We were organizing a big bier pong tournament, and I was asked if I could make an Excel
table for it, but I thought to myself that there are better ways, so I started to program
a small tournament handler in svelte. Because I really liked may idea and what I made, I
decided to make this into a proper Project. Sadly my code I wrote the first time is
really messy, so I am coding it new.
